Create a project
====================

If this is your first time using MonkTrader, you'll have to take care of some
initial setup. Namely, you'll need to auto-generate some codes that establishes
a MonkTrader project -- a collection of settings for an instance of MonkTrader.

From the command line, ``cd`` into a directory where you'd like to store your
code, then run the following command:

.. console::

    $ MonkTrader startstrategy mystrategy

This will create a ``mystrategy`` directory in your current directory.
